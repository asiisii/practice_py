- Use Lists if you want to store ordered collections of data that can be changed. They are suitable for storing collections of items that need to be ordered and manipulated, such as a list of names or prices. 
  - Example: [1, 2, 3, 4]

- Use Tuples if you want to store ordered collections of data that cannot be changed. They are suitable for storing collections of items that need to be ordered but cannot be changed, such as a record of dates or measurement values.
  - Example: (1, 2, 3, 4)

- Use Sets if you want to store unique elements. They are suitable for removing duplicates from a list or storing items that don't have a specific order, such as unique words in a document.
  - Example: {1, 2, 3, 4}

- Use Dictionaries if you want to store key-value pairs. They are suitable for organizing data into pairs, where each pair consists of a key and its associated value, such as the capital of a country or the definition of a word.
  - Example: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
